# Taint

```
0/6 nodes are available: 6 node(s) had taint {eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type: fargate}, that the pod didn't tolerate.
```
Delete taints.

```
$ kubectl taint nodes --all eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type=fargate:NoSchedule-
```

Too many pods error. Fixed by creating a new fargate profile for the namespace.
